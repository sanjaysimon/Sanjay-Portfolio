                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the 
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State 
                of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his 
                mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth 
                between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and 
                one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with 
                numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal 
                Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business 
                had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as 
                well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to 
                the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost 
                by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was 
                born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who 
                had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his 
                education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's 
                College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in 
                physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of 
                Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his
                 lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the 
                 next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting
                  you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed achieving his 
                  dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
                   available in the IAF.
